            <h2>Hi, I'm Andrea</h2>
            
            <p>
                I'm a budding software developer. I finished my Master's in Computer Science from 
                Portland State University in 2018 with emphasis in Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning. After graduating, 
                I came out as transgender. I'm working to
                re-enter the workforce after spending a couple years taking care of my kids as a stay-at-home mom.
                Currently I'm leveling up my web development skills by following online courses and developing 
                my own personal projects. This site showcases those projects and also provides a outlet for me to 
                practice my html and css skills. 
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                Graduating with honors in physics in 2007, she has since had a diverse life experience working 
                as an intern for nonprofits advocating for programs benefiting low income households in the United States, 
                obtaining a graduate degree in economics in 2010 with an emphasis on natural resource economics, and a 
                master's degree in computer science in 2018 with an emphasis on machine learning and artifical intelligence. 
                She came out as transgender in April 2018. In the last two years she has focused on being a primary caregiver 
                to her two children as well as developing her software skills, and is now returning to the workforce seeking 
                employment in web development, data science, or other software engineering opportunities, especially in the 
                fields of education, science, or health.

            <h3>Master's Thesis: Object Localization in Images Using Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            
            <p>
                For my Master's thesis, I developed a reinforcement learning model to improve object localization 
                in images. I developed the model from scratch using Python, the Python Imaging Library (PIL), and the Scikit-Learn library.
