        <h2>Hi I'm Andrea (She/Her)</h2>
        <img src="Images/githubprofilepic.jfif">
        <p>
            I'm a budding software developer. I finished my Master's in Computer Science from 
            Portland State University in 2018 with a specialty in AI/ML. After graduating, 
            I came out as transgender. I'm working to
            re-enter the workforce after spending a couple years taking care of my kids as a stay-at-home mom.
            Currently I'm leveling up my web development skills by following online courses and developing 
            my own personal projects. This site showcases those projects and also provides a outlet for me to 
            practice my html and css skills.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="project-tile">
        <h3><a href='physicsJSDemo.html'>PhysicsJS</a></h3>
        <p>A simple 2D physics engine developed from scratch using vanilla javascript and visualized
            with HTML5's canvas element.

    <div class="project-tile">
        <h3><a href='easterbubble.html'>Easter Bubbles Canvas Demo</a></h3>
        <p>A predecessor to PhysicsJS, this canvas demo is based on following a youtube tutorial by 
            <a href='https://youtu.be/EO6OkltgudE'>Chris courses</a>. It's a simple visualization of colorful
            circles bouncing around the screen. The circles react to mouse movements by growing large when they pass
            near the mouse's curser.</p>

    <div class="project-tile">
        <h3><a href='thesis.html'>Master's Thesis: Object Localization in Images Using Reinforcement Learning</a></h3>
        <p>For my Master's thesis, I developed a reinforcement learning model to improve object localization 
            in images. I developed the model from scratch using Python, the Python Imaging Library (PIL), and the Scikit-Learn library.
